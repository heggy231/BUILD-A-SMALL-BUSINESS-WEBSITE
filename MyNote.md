1) Creative ways to use background images
2) How to group and position multiple elements with CSS

1) Creative ways to use background images
  - <div> multi-purpose tag (allows style group of elememts with the same CSS)
  We are going to layer descriptive text over a picture of what each dish looks like.

  - Anna's site, all HTML inside <body>; which affect every single page element with CSS body style, only write once!

  - Jeff's blog <article> tag as a container for post titles and content.  Then you created an article style in the CSS that controlled the appearance of the tag contained inside of each article.

  - <article> tag is a semantic tag: it ways something useful, and defining, about its content.  ex) semantic tags <header>, <nav> (short for navigation), or <footer>.

  - <div> tag: non-semantic, for all purpose: can use it as a container to group any type of content so it can be styled by a single bit of CSS.

Wrap all 3 menu items with opening and closing div tags.
Next, style div tag! (height 200px)
